Security Notes</A>
</H2>
Encryption algorithms can be broken in several ways.  If you have some
ciphertext and know (or can guess) the corresponding plaintext, you can
simply try every possible key in a known-plaintext attack.  Or, it
might be possible to encrypt text of your choice using an unknown key;
for example, you might mail someone a message intending it to be
encrypted and forwarded to someone else.  This is a
chosen-plaintext attack, which is particularly effective if it's
possible to choose plaintexts that reveal something about the key when
encrypted.

<P>
DES (5100 K/sec) has a 56-bit key; this is starting to become too small
for safety.  It has been estimated that it would only cost $1,000,000 to
build a custom DES-cracking machine that could find a key in 3 hours.  A
chosen-ciphertext attack using the technique of linear
cryptanalysis can break DES in pow(2, 43) steps.  However,
unless you're encrypting data that you want to be safe from major
governments, DES will be fine. DES3 (1830 K/sec) uses three DES
encryptions for greater security and a 112-bit or 168-bit key, but is
correspondingly slower.

<P>
There are no publicly known attacks against IDEA (3050 K/sec), and
it's been around long enough to have been examined.  There are no
known attacks against ARC2 (2160 K/sec), ARC4 (8830 K/sec), Blowfish
(9250 K/sec), CAST (2960 K/sec), or RC5 (2060 K/sec), but they're all
relatively new algorithms and there hasn't been time for much analysis
to be performed; use them for serious applications only after careful
research.

<P>
AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard, was chosen by the US National
Institute of Standards and Technology from among 6 competitors, and is
probably your best choice.  It runs at 7060 K/sec, so it's among the
faster algorithms around.
