Such systems already exists, designed and peer reviewed by experts. The 
primarily problem they face is acceptance - and the lack of acceptance 
because of the trade-offs made to make the protocols acceptable. And 
nobody with real-world need for email can rely on such protocols before 
everybody else uses them, and thus there is no need to deploy the 
protocols before everybody else uses them.

&gt;<i> Let me try to state the problem in more fundamental terms.  A stranger

</I>&gt;<i> information you have to verify that claim is a DNS text record at
</I>&gt;<i> mailout09.arizona.edu. That record can hold up to 480 bytes of text.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
The DNS system is fundamentally broken and insecure. You shouldn't rely 
on it at all. Secure DNS is really a must but unfortunately not widely 
deployed, so we must rely on DNS for functionality but shouldn't rely on 
it for security.

&gt;<i> criminals.  More secure sites can add additional checks, including a
</I>&gt;<i> digital signature on the entire message.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
IMHO the right solution to the problem you are trying to solve lies in 
that direction. Why try to find another and less perfect solution?

But ... this is a (silent) list for python crypto, not for protocol 
design and email systems. Other lists might be more appropriate.
