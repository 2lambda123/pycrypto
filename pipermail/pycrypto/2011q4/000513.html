Yes, I agree 100%, this is something I'm not taking lightly, that's why I'm trying to get it right the first time :).

Ill checkout your link, thank you very much for your input.

John,

I don&#8217;t mean to steal your thunder, I noticed you asked a question about the suitability of public key cryptography for file encryption and the use of padding. Unless one is an expert in cryptography I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to encrypt sensitive data using your own scheme as cryptography is very easy to get wrong with catastrophic consequences, even &#8216;experts&#8217; make mistakes. Rather it would be safer to use an established scheme, you also need to think about the integrity of what you are encrypting &#8211; although you may have taken this into account. I am not an expert in cryptography and I appreciate and admire the work that has gone into PyCrypto. I am speaking from past experiences and I thought I would share these with you.

You may find this link useful: <A HREF="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/8571/rsa-4096-with-aes-256-encryption-process-using-pycrypto">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/8571/rsa-4096-with-aes-256-encryption-process-using-pycrypto</A>

Python makes it quite easy.
 The reason I started to use it!
