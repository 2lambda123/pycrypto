<PRE>Hi,

Do you guys know roughly when this will go in?

Also with import/export RSA keys can we support bcrypt?

Does JCA and BouncyCastle use bcrypt, eg:

'BcryptWithHMAC-SHA1AndAES256-CBC'

Thanks,
Kurt

</I>&gt;<i>   I am not very clear what the benefit enums might bring? One option I

</I>&gt;<i>   instead of one (since protection mainly depends on type of KDF, PRF,

</I>&gt;<i>   uses case are about the desire to protect the private key using a

</I>&gt;<i> parameters
</I>&gt;<i>   is not that relevant. Plus, exportKey() parameter list becomes to long.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I am really ashamed to admit that I actually have 9 pull requests

</I>&gt;<i>   It is of course only up to him to decide which features should go

</I>&gt;<i>   few features and bugfixes may go into any next release.
</I>&gt;<i>   The release merge window seems to roughly be once per year and I
</I>&gt;<i> find it is natural to have so many outstanding pull requests by now.
</I>&gt;<i>   To my defense, I can only say that the all pull requests cover one
</I>&gt;<i> feature only and that I try to keep them as independent as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>   Most of them apply cleanly to master (e.g. HKDF, CCM, PKCS#8, bug
</I>fixes, etc).
&gt;<i>   In some cases though, they do depend on an existing pull request (as
</I>&gt;<i> in the case of DSA import/export depending on PKCS8 be applied first),
</I>&gt;<i>   because keeping them separated is honestly too much work for me
</I>&gt;<i> *and* they are indeed extensions of other extensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi, I was looking at the pycrypto pull request
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/pull/32.">https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/pull/32.</A>  Just a few comments...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * For readability can you pep8 format the code?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * RSA, for import/export the protection parameter maybe rename to algo
</I>or
&gt;<i> &gt; wrap algo?  It evolves from: 'protection' to 'wrap_algo' to 'mode' as it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goes down the call stack.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Also maybe make this parameter an enum/value?  Since the long string
</I>can
&gt;<i> &gt; be error prone, low level code would need to change anyway if it were
</I>either
&gt;<i> &gt; string or int if we support more modes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * And last but not least... I'm new to this email list and not sure how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; often pull requests are accepted but maybe you could reduce the amount
</I>of
&gt;<i> &gt; features going in?  I know you have another one, 51, after this...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maintainer may reluctant to do massive changes all at once?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway just ideas...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for your time,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kurt
