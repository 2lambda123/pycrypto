</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've released a keyring companion package today:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	<A HREF="https://github.com/frispete/keyrings.cryptfile">https://github.com/frispete/keyrings.cryptfile</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keyrings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As such, it uses manually parameterized argon2 hashes as KDF, and AES in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OCB mode as stream cipher (well, it just encrypts the password for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; given service/user name). Granted, the advantages of OCB are not /that/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crucial here :wink:, but apart from technical factors, the exclusion of

Don't get you here. Yes, the package contains just a MIT license file for now. 

&gt;<i> I assume that you are
</I>&gt;<i> aware that no anti-mil clause exists in co-existence with free software
</I>&gt;<i> licenses
</I>&gt;<i> and your sentence was just written in an
</I>&gt;<i> odd way?
</I>
First, bear with me, as I'm not a native speaker. Sometimes, my expressions 
tend to confuse people. I'm sorry about that. Second, I'm not a lawyer.

As long as I use OCB in OSS and does not sue somebody else about it, License 1 
is granted, if I read the OCB license options correctly [1]. Anyway, I will 
add the OCB license to the package and add a note in the initial password 
retrieval dialog about it..

In this projects state, I would like to discuss the technical issues first.
&lt;OT&gt; As said, I sympathize with the idea of the license, since I personally 
believe, that military conflicts doesn't solve any problems, but many todays 
problems originate from them.&lt;/OT&gt;

&gt;<i> &gt; by its license is rather *attractive* from my POV(!). But I'm open for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussions of course.

Cheers,
Pete
