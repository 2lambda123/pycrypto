Hi Christoph

I did a quick search and found this:

<A HREF="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm">http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm</A>

diff is what is used to create the patch file. You then simply need to run patch to execute it on the necessary files.

Hope that helps.

If you still need help on fixing the issues let me know and I will see what I can do :)

Hi Grail!



I think in you need to return the pointer from the newly created
module. Currently the return value seems to be a dangling pointer.

A &quot;return m&quot; at the end of the generic init function in
block_template.c may help.



Btw, in Windows, there are still a few issues which prevent successful
compilation. 

Should I generate a patch? If yes, could you probably give me a hint
how to generate this patch?



Btw, there seems to be a test suite included (python setup.py test).
However, at that stage it is not too much of 

help, because the test suite itself needs to be adapted as well. In
Python 2 the test suite works perfectly fine.



Cheers,

Christoph

  Hello
Christoph
  

  
  I have made more head way since that one (and made a lot more
changes).
  I found that the module creation required a few more steps and I
have come up 
  with two solutions (in attached patches):
  

  
  1. First patch follows most of the online info I could find
related to PyModuleDef and the related PyTypeObject.
     This required that all tp_getattr functions be removed and
set to 0 (zero) in the PyTypeObject definition.
  

  
  2. The second patch retained the already created tp_getattr
functions.
  

  
  With either applied I am able to compile but when running a test
program with the following lines only:
  

  
  #!/usr/bin/env python
  

  
  from Crypto.Cipher import AES
  import base64
  import os
  

  
  

  
  When run I receive the following error:
  

  
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File &quot;./cypher.py&quot;, line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
      from Crypto.Cipher import AES
  SystemError: NULL result without error in PyObject_Call
  

  
  So apply patches (and make necessary changes for Windows) and we
will see if I can help further :)
  

  
  Cheers Grail
