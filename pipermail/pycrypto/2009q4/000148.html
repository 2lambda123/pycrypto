Hi,

&gt;<i> [I should correct the terminology I used in my previous email: 
</I>&gt;<i> mpz_probab_prime_p doesn't implement a deterministic test (as I suggested); 
</I>&gt;<i> it implements the probabilistic Rabin-Miller test deterministically.  As a
</I>&gt;<i> result, the theoretical guarantee normally provided by the Rabin-Miller 
</I>&gt;<i> probabilistic test (at most a 25% false positive probability per
</I>&gt;<i> iteration) is void.]
</I>
Yes. I realized this yesturday when I looked at the gmp code. Do you have any idea why they did go for the non-deterministic version (and not seed the PRNG)? 
I think the PRNG bug you mentioned earlier can't have anything to do with it because a potential attacker would have no influence on when the test is performed and thus when (and with what seed) the PRNG is seeded.

&gt;&gt;<i>Maybe one could then later replace/extend it to a Baillie&#8211;PSW primality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>test which has no pseudo-prime numbers up to at least 10^15.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.  Of course, for crypto, we really only need to worry about primes 
</I>&gt;<i> larger than 2^2047 (10^616).   Does Baillie-PSW offer a theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> maximum probability of error like Rabin-Miller does?
</I>
Baillie-PSW is just a combination of (as I understand it) a single Rabin-Miller-Tests followed by a strong Lucas-Selfridge test.
There seems to be no pseudoprimes below 2^64 (not yet confirmed) [1] and others seem to estimate that there are non below 10000 [2].
As that may be I couldn't find a mathamatical proof of any boundary so if we are worried about that we could still do n Rabin-Miller test to get the mathamaticly proven probability of 4^{-n} and then do a Lucas test for better *assumed* probability.
There are some concerns that the Lucas test might not be computationally feasable for large numbers [1]. 
So for now this is just an option one can take a look at once the other parts are in place because it wouldn't replace anything but rather extend it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - We'll need some unit tests to do some basic sanity checks on the output
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    of this new function?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I agree. but what do you have in mind exactly? do you want to do an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>*exact* primality test? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, I just want to test for obvious coding errors.  For example, we
</I>&gt;<i> could check for &quot;primes&quot; that are even, or wrong sized primes (e.g if you 
</I>&gt;<i> ask for a 2048-bit prime and get a 2047-bit number instead).  We could also 
</I>&gt;<i> test a new isPrime() by including some pseudoprimes that currently fool 
</I>&gt;<i> isPrime (Thomas R. Nicely has generated some).
</I>
I see. This sounds reasonable.


BTW, is there a certain Python version you want to support?
I ask because yesturday I caught myself writing &quot;x = x if y else z&quot;. I'll replace that particular line with the equivalent &quot;if ... else ...&quot; construct, but it made me wonder if there are any further constraints.


OK, so I'll work on these (supporting randfunc, probabilistic Rabin-Miller-Test, python versions and unit tests) and send in a patch when I think it's review worthy.
I might even get it done until the weekend. let's see about that.


sincerely yours
//Lorenz
