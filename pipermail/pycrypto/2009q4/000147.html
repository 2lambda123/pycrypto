I haven't thought much about elliptic curve crypto, partly because I don't 
know very much about it, except that it's faster than RSA and that it's a 
bit of a patent minefield (though apparently the people responsible for 
seccure are taking care to avoid the patented stuff).

Since seccure is licensed under the (L?)GPL (and most of PyCrypto is either 
public domain or permissively licensed), I would probably not include it 
directly in PyCrypto, but make it a separate plug-in extension library.

I'm mostly focusing on strengthening the stuff that PyCrypto already has 
right now.
