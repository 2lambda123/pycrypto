<PRE>PyCrypto 2.1.0 has been released.  This is the first stable release since I
took over as maintainer of PyCrypto.  It is compatible with Python 2.1 
through 2.6.  (Python 3.x is not yet supported.)

You can download this release from <A HREF="http://www.pycrypto.org/">http://www.pycrypto.org/</A>

It has the following SHA256 sums:

253e1c22ea0249f0429df4f7e2eb973b119c83b146c0f421298f5e8e6822d8a2 *pycrypto-2.1.0.tar.gz
ed296d283e367a47b5fb8ed17309bd3e67a1e712caae519fb0bbff5ad0723eda *pycrypto-2.1.0.tar.gz.asc

Please test it and post your experiences to the PyCrypto mailing list:

     <A HREF="http://lists.dlitz.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pycrypto">pycrypto at lists.dlitz.net</A>

and/or file bug reports on Launchpad:

     <A HREF="https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto">https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto</A>

Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of changes between 2.0.1 and 2.1.0:

2.1.0
=====

	* Fix building PyCrypto on Win64 using MS Visual Studio 9.
	  (Thanks: Nevins Bartolomeo.)


2.1.0beta1
==========

	* Modified RSA.generate() to ensure that e is coprime to p-1 and q-1.
	  Apparently, RSA.generate was capable of generating unusable keys.


2.1.0alpha2
===========

	* Modified isPrime() to release the global interpreter lock while
	  performing computations. (patch from Lorenz Quack)

	* Release the GIL while encrypting, decrypting, and hashing (but not
	  during initialization or finalization).

	* API changes:

	  - Removed RandomPoolCompat and made Crypto.Util.randpool.RandomPool
	    a wrapper around Crypto.Random that emits a DeprecationWarning.
	    This is to discourage developers from attempting to provide
	    backwards compatibility for systems where there are NO strong
	    entropy sources available.

	  - Added Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes().  This should allow people
	    to use something like this if they want backwards-compatibility:

	        try:
	             from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
	        except ImportError:
	             try:
	                 from os import urandom as get_random_bytes
	             except ImportError:
	                 get_random_bytes = open(&quot;/dev/urandom&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;).read

	  - Implemented __ne__() on pubkey, which fixes the following broken
	    behaviour:
	        &gt;&gt;&gt; pk.publickey() == pk.publickey()
	        True
	        &gt;&gt;&gt; pk.publickey() != pk.publickey()
	        True
	    (patch from Lorenz Quack)

	  - Block ciphers created with MODE_CTR can now operate on strings of
	    any size, rather than just multiples of the underlying cipher's
	    block size.

	  - Crypto.Util.Counter objects now raise OverflowError when they wrap
	    around to zero.  You can override this new behaviour by passing
	    allow_wraparound=True to Counter.new()


2.1.0alpha1
===========

	* This version supports Python versions 2.1 through 2.6.

	* Clarified copyright status of much of the existing code by tracking
	  down Andrew M. Kuchling, Barry A. Warsaw, Jeethu Rao, Joris Bontje,
	  Mark Moraes, Paul Swartz, Robey Pointer, and Wim Lewis and getting
	  their permission to clarify the license/public-domain status of their
	  contributions.  Many thanks to all involved!

	* Replaced the test suite with a new, comprehensive package
	  (Crypto.SelfTest) that includes documentation about where its test
	  vectors came from, or how they were derived.

	  Use &quot;python setup.py test&quot; to run the tests after building.

	* API changes:

	  - Added Crypto.version_info, which from now on will contain version
	    information in a format similar to Python's sys.version_info.

	  - Added a new random numbers API (Crypto.Random), and deprecated the
	    old one (Crypto.Util.randpool.RandomPool), which was misused more
	    often than not.

	    The new API is used by invoking Crypto.Random.new() and then just
	    reading from the file-like object that is returned.

	    CAVEAT: To maintain the security of the PRNG, you must call
	    Crypto.Random.atfork() in both the parent and the child processes
	    whenever you use os.fork().  Otherwise, the parent and child will
	    share copies of the same entropy pool, causing them to return the
	    same results!  This is a limitation of Python, which does not
	    provide readily-accessible hooks to os.fork().  It's also a
	    limitation caused by the failure of operating systems to provide
	    sufficiently fast, trustworthy sources of cryptographically-strong
	    random numbers.

	  - Crypto.PublicKey now raises ValueError/TypeError/RuntimeError
	    instead of the various custom &quot;error&quot; exceptions

	  - Removed the IDEA and RC5 modules due to software patents.  Debian
	    has been doing this for a while

	  - Added Crypto.Random.random, a strong version of the standard Python
	   'random' module.

	  - Added Crypto.Util.Counter, providing fast counter implementations
	    for use with CTR-mode ciphers.

	* Bug fixes:

	  - Fixed padding bug in SHA256; this resulted in bad digests whenever
	    (the number of bytes hashed) mod 64 == 55.

	  - Fixed a 32-bit limitation on the length of messages the SHA256 module
	    could hash.

	  - AllOrNothing: Fixed padding bug in digest()

	  - Fixed a bad behaviour of the XOR cipher module: It would silently
	    truncate all keys to 32 bytes.  Now it raises ValueError when the
	    key is too long.

	  - DSA: Added code to enforce FIPS 186-2 requirements on the size of
	    the prime p

	  - Fixed the winrandom module, which had been omitted from the build
	    process, causing security problems for programs that misuse RandomPool.

	  - Fixed infinite loop when attempting to generate RSA keys with an
	    odd number of bits in the modulus.  (Not that you should do that.)

	* Clarified the documentation for Crypto.Util.number.getRandomNumber.

	  Confusingly, this function does NOT return N random bits; It returns
	  a random N-bit number, i.e. a random number between 2**(N-1) and (2**N)-1.

	  Note that getRandomNumber is for internal use only and may be
	  renamed or removed in future releases.

	* Replaced RIPEMD.c with a new implementation (RIPEMD160.c) to
	  alleviate copyright concerns.

	* Replaced the DES/DES3 modules with ones based on libtomcrypt-1.16 to
	  alleviate copyright concerns.

	* Replaced Blowfish.c with a new implementation to alleviate copyright
	  concerns.

	* Added a string-XOR implementation written in C (Crypto.Util.strxor)
	  and used it to speed up Crypto.Hash.HMAC

	* Converted documentation to reStructured Text.

	* Added epydoc configuration Doc/epydoc-config

	* setup.py now emits a warning when building without GMP.

	* Added pct-speedtest.py to the source tree for doing performance
	  testing on the new code.

	* Cleaned up the code in several places.


Thanks to everyone who helped make this release possible!

Cheers,
- Dwayne
