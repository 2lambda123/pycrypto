</I>
Yes, that makes sense.

&gt;&gt;<i>    If I applied the patch as it stands, it would introduce a security

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    similar to CVE-2008-0166 (the Debian-specific openssl PRNG bug).

</I>&gt;<i>in which the program has been started and thus determine a small set of 
</I>&gt;<i>possible seeds which then can be brute-forced?
</I>
Yes, exactly.

&gt;&gt;<i>    To fix this, we're going to need Python and C implementations  of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Miller-Rabin probabilistic primality test.  These implementations will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    need to accept a callable Python &quot;randfunc&quot; parameter (like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Crypto.Util.number.getRandomNumber does) so they can get random numbers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    from a cryptographically strong PRNG (i.e. Crypto.Random).
</I>&gt;<i>I'm confused. It sounds like this paragraph is in part referring to the next point.
</I>&gt;<i>I don't see what the primality testing has to do with the PRNG problem.
</I>&gt;<i>The second point (supporting a &quot;randfunc&quot; parameter) however I could 
</I>&gt;<i>implement.
</I>
Ok, ignore what I wrote there.  I can't think of a good way of explaining 
what I mean right now.  There are a few concepts that are intertwined.

&gt;&gt;<i> - PyCrypto's *current* isPrime() function needs improvement.  It uses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    mpz_probab_prime_p, which is a *deterministic* variant of Miller-Rabin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (see <A HREF="http://www.trnicely.net/misc/mpzspsp.html">http://www.trnicely.net/misc/mpzspsp.html</A>).  That's fine for RSA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> key
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    generation, but totally insecure if you want to validate negotiated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Diffie-Hellman parameters, for example.  Do you think you could make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    isPrime() take advantage of getStrongPrime()'s primality testing code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That won't do any good. The primality testing in getStrongPrime is also 
</I>&gt;<i>deterministic. It uses a sieve (the base is the first 10000 primes) and 
</I>&gt;<i>then some rounds (currently 25 as suggested in the paper) of 
</I>&gt;<i>mpz_probab_prime_p(). 
</I>
Yes, I agree.  This would only be useful once getStrongPrime() is modified 
to use a proper random number source.

[I should correct the terminology I used in my previous email: 
mpz_probab_prime_p doesn't implement a deterministic test (as I suggested); 
it implements the probabilistic Rabin-Miller test deterministically.  As a 
result, the theoretical guarantee normally provided by the Rabin-Miller 
probabilistic test (at most a 25% false positive probability per iteration) 
is void.]

&gt;<i>So I guess what you are suggesting is that we implement our own 
</I>&gt;<i>non-deterministic Rabin-Miller test (again we would need a C and python 
</I>&gt;<i>version). That might not be a bad idea because right now we have some 
</I>&gt;<i>redundancy in that mpz_probab_prime_p also uses a sieve (with a smaller 
</I>&gt;<i>base) before doing the Rabin-Miller tests. We could then avoid that 
</I>&gt;<i>overhead.
</I>
Yes, exactly.

&gt;<i>Maybe one could then later replace/extend it to a Baillie&#8211;PSW primality 
</I>&gt;<i>test which has no pseudo-prime numbers up to at least 10^15.
</I>
Yes.  Of course, for crypto, we really only need to worry about primes 
larger than 2^2047 (10^616).   Does Baillie-PSW offer a theoretical maximum 
probability of error like Rabin-Miller does?

&gt;&gt;<i> - We'll need some unit tests to do some basic sanity checks on the output
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    of this new function?
</I>&gt;<i>I agree. but what do you have in mind exactly? do you want to do an 
</I>&gt;<i>*exact* primality test? 
</I>
No. :)

Basically, I just want to test for obvious coding errors.  For example, we 
could check for &quot;primes&quot; that are even, or wrong sized primes (e.g if you 
ask for a 2048-bit prime and get a 2047-bit number instead).  We could also 
test a new isPrime() by including some pseudoprimes that currently fool 
isPrime (Thomas R. Nicely has generated some).

&gt;&gt;<i> How much of the above are you comfortable with?  I can probably pick up a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lot of it if necessary, though in that case it's going to have to wait
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until after PyCrypto 2.1.0 is released.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The python implementation of getStrongPrime() should be straight forward 
</I>&gt;<i>so I can do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Also taking the additional randfunc parameter shouldn't be to hard.
</I>&gt;<i>I'm not so sure about implementing a Rabin-Miller test. I don't know 
</I>&gt;<i>exactly how it works and would need to make some research first. but from 
</I>&gt;<i>what I read so far it shouldn't be to hard to implement. But you said that 
</I>&gt;<i>for RSA the current deterministic approach is fine so this is for a future 
</I>&gt;<i>version which includes a Diffie-Hellman keyexchange.
</I>
Yes, that sounds good.

&gt;<i>Concerning the Unittests. I guess I could moc up some initial tests but I 
</I>&gt;<i>don't know what exactly you have in mind.
</I>
Again, I'm not looking for a lot here.  Just something that exercises all 
of the code and does some basic checks.

&gt;<i>further more I would like a comment on whether I got the thing with the 
</I>&gt;<i>public exponent e right.
</I>
That's the part I don't understand, and why I asked for help with this in 
the first place.  I unfortunately don't know very much about the math 
behind RSA. :-/

I'll look at it again this weekend if I have time and I remember.

Also, thanks for posting your earlier test results.

&gt;<i>P.S.: I'm not a national, citizen nor a resident of the USA. I gladly put 
</I>&gt;<i>my current, past and future contributions to PyCrypto into the public 
</I>&gt;<i>domain and I agree to the terms listed under the &quot;PyCrypto Code Submission 
</I>&gt;<i>Requirements - Rev. C&quot;.  The code I write is not of USA origin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think the paper the code was based on might be of USA origin but I don't 
</I>&gt;<i>think that is a legal problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I hope that takes care of the legal stuff.
</I>
Thanks for mentioning that.  It helps me keep things straight.

Cheers,
- Dwayne
