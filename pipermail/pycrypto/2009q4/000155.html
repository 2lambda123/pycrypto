<PRE>PyCrypto 2.1.0b1 has been released.  This is the first beta release since I
took over as maintainer of PyCrypto.

You can download this release from <A HREF="http://www.pycrypto.org/">http://www.pycrypto.org/</A>

It has the following SHA256 sums:

7be4be8262ed8443700eed71e498e9b8d8a5ac17f3a00abc112c81753ffec9ba *pycrypto-2.1.0b1.tar.gz
d4f628937c04faa5daaf4bd99e7c7ecbcd90e43f9291bcbc5a428ceacdd80f21 *pycrypto-2.1.0b1.tar.gz.asc

Please test it and post your experiences to the PyCrypto mailing list:

    <A HREF="http://lists.dlitz.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pycrypto">pycrypto at lists.dlitz.net</A>

and/or file bug reports on Launchpad:

    <A HREF="https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto">https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto</A>

Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of changes between 2.0.1 and 2.1.0beta1:

2.1.0beta1
==========

         * Modified RSA.generate() to ensure that e is coprime to p-1 and q-1.
           Apparently, RSA.generate was capable of generating unusable keys.


2.1.0alpha2
===========

         * Modified isPrime() to release the global interpreter lock while
           performing computations. (patch from Lorenz Quack)

         * Release the GIL while encrypting, decrypting, and hashing (but not
           during initialization or finalization).

         * API changes:

           - Removed RandomPoolCompat and made Crypto.Util.randpool.RandomPool
             a wrapper around Crypto.Random that emits a DeprecationWarning.
             This is to discourage developers from attempting to provide
             backwards compatibility for systems where there are NO strong
             entropy sources available.

           - Added Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes().  This should allow people
             to use something like this if they want backwards-compatibility:

                 try:
                      from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
                 except ImportError:
                      try:
                          from os import urandom as get_random_bytes
                      except ImportError:
                          get_random_bytes = open(&quot;/dev/urandom&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;).read

           - Implemented __ne__() on pubkey, which fixes the following broken
             behaviour:
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; pk.publickey() == pk.publickey()
                 True
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; pk.publickey() != pk.publickey()
                 True
             (patch from Lorenz Quack)

           - Block ciphers created with MODE_CTR can now operate on strings of
             any size, rather than just multiples of the underlying cipher's
             block size.

           - Crypto.Util.Counter objects now raise OverflowError when they wrap
             around to zero.  You can override this new behaviour by passing
             allow_wraparound=True to Counter.new()


2.1.0alpha1
===========

    * This version supports Python versions 2.1 through 2.6.

    * Clarified copyright status of much of the existing code by tracking
      down Andrew M. Kuchling, Barry A. Warsaw, Jeethu Rao, Joris Bontje,
      Mark Moraes, Paul Swartz, Robey Pointer, and Wim Lewis and getting
      their permission to clarify the license/public-domain status of their
      contributions.  Many thanks to all involved!

    * Replaced the test suite with a new, comprehensive package
      (Crypto.SelfTest) that includes documentation about where its test
      vectors came from, or how they were derived.

      Use &quot;python setup.py test&quot; to run the tests after building.

    * API changes:

      - Added Crypto.version_info, which from now on will contain version
        information in a format similar to Python's sys.version_info.

      - Added a new random numbers API (Crypto.Random), and deprecated the
        old one (Crypto.Util.randpool.RandomPool), which was misused more
        often than not.

        The new API is used by invoking Crypto.Random.new() and then just
        reading from the file-like object that is returned.

        CAVEAT: To maintain the security of the PRNG, you must call
        Crypto.Random.atfork() in both the parent and the child processes
        whenever you use os.fork().  Otherwise, the parent and child will
        share copies of the same entropy pool, causing them to return the
        same results!  This is a limitation of Python, which does not
        provide readily-accessible hooks to os.fork().  It's also a
        limitation caused by the failure of operating systems to provide
        sufficiently fast, trustworthy sources of cryptographically-strong
        random numbers.

      - Crypto.PublicKey now raises ValueError/TypeError/RuntimeError
        instead of the various custom &quot;error&quot; exceptions

      - Removed the IDEA and RC5 modules due to software patents.  Debian
        has been doing this for a while

      - Added Crypto.Random.random, a strong version of the standard Python
       'random' module.

      - Added Crypto.Util.Counter, providing fast counter implementations
        for use with CTR-mode ciphers.

    * Bug fixes:

      - Fixed padding bug in SHA256; this resulted in bad digests whenever
        (the number of bytes hashed) mod 64 == 55.

      - Fixed a 32-bit limitation on the length of messages the SHA256 module
        could hash.

      - AllOrNothing: Fixed padding bug in digest()

      - Fixed a bad behaviour of the XOR cipher module: It would silently
        truncate all keys to 32 bytes.  Now it raises ValueError when the
        key is too long.

      - DSA: Added code to enforce FIPS 186-2 requirements on the size of
        the prime p

      - Fixed the winrandom module, which had been omitted from the build
        process, causing security problems for programs that misuse RandomPool.

      - Fixed infinite loop when attempting to generate RSA keys with an
        odd number of bits in the modulus.  (Not that you should do that.)

    * Clarified the documentation for Crypto.Util.number.getRandomNumber.

      Confusingly, this function does NOT return N random bits; It returns
      a random N-bit number, i.e. a random number between 2**(N-1) and
      (2**N)-1.

      Note that getRandomNumber is for internal use only and may be
      renamed or removed in future releases.

    * Replaced RIPEMD.c with a new implementation (RIPEMD160.c) to
      alleviate copyright concerns.

    * Replaced the DES/DES3 modules with ones based on libtomcrypt-1.16 to
      alleviate copyright concerns.

    * Replaced Blowfish.c with a new implementation to alleviate copyright
      concerns.

    * Added a string-XOR implementation written in C (Crypto.Util.strxor)
      and used it to speed up Crypto.Hash.HMAC

    * Converted documentation to reStructured Text.

    * Added epydoc configuration Doc/epydoc-config

    * setup.py now emits a warning when building without GMP.

    * Added pct-speedtest.py to the source tree for doing performance
      testing on the new code.

    * Cleaned up the code in several places.

Cheers!
   - Dwayne
