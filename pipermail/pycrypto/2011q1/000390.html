<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>I personally think it's a good idea but I'm curious about what Dwayne thinks.
After all he still is the maintainer of PyCrypto. I'm just a random passers-by.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
I feel the same way. Ideally, the survey can be a tool to help Dwayne. And also to help the Python maintainers: There was mention that there's no user feedback on crypto (in the &quot;crypto to the stdlib&quot; thread). Well, we can help change that.

I made some changes to the survey, as I thought all of your suggestions were good. Take another look, if you would.


&gt;<i> Here some comments on your poll-draft:
</I>&gt;<i>    * It says &quot;pycrypto annual user survey&quot;. &quot;annual&quot; really?
</I>I was attempting to be funny, tongue-in-cheek. Clearly, that failed. 
Being less whimsical is fine. :)

&gt;<i>    * Can you make the questions conditional? For example if in the first question &quot;Do you currently use pycrypto?&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> answer &quot;No&quot;, then the following questions don't make to much sense.
</I>I tried, and failed. It wouldn't progress at all then. With your broader 
scope of the survey, the point has happily become moot, though.
&gt;<i>    * maybe one could ask what cryptographic python library the people use. &quot;pycrypto, ezpycrypto, cryptopp, pytomcrypt,
</I>&gt;<i> ..., custom implementation, other (which one?), none&quot;
</I>Good idea.
&gt;<i>    * I would maybe add the possibility for arbitrary comments. either regarding pycrypto or the poll itself.
</I>Okay. Plenty of long-text forms already, one more doesn't hurt.

Thorsten
