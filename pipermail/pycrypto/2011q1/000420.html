<PRE>Dwayne,


&gt;<i> No, each commit should be a distinct change (and each distinct change
</I>&gt;<i> should have its own commit).  Having separate commits for the following
</I>&gt;<i> makes sense:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       - Replace tabs with spaces
</I>&gt;<i>       - Py3K _fastmath.c support
</I>&gt;<i>       - Change _fastmath.c to compile with VC++
</I>&gt;<i>       - add MPIR support
</I>&gt;<i>       - Add Ron Rivest Test
</I>&gt;<i>       - Add unit tests for Crypto.Random.random
</I>&gt;<i>       - Update documentation with current state of security of hash and
</I>&gt;<i>         cipher functions.
</I>&gt;<i>       - Update documentation with Python 3.x notes.
</I>&gt;<i>       - Add unit test for AllOrNothing
</I>&gt;<i>       - Fix AllOrNothing and random.sample()
</I>
I took a stab at just a portion of this, the first _fastmath.c changes. 
The result is that I have a lot of conflicts, and after resolving those, 
I have code that won't compile.

I can't easily untangle these changes: The additional unit tests either 
presume that the py3k compatibility layer is there, or are needed to 
make the library work under py3k.

I have a limited amount of enthusiasm for fixing that which already 
works, so it fits into a neater order. Here's my compromise proposal:

I will change the unit tests to wrap the test vectors in a different 
place, instead of wrapping the literals, as we had discussed.

And I will give you a branch with one commit that has all of the changes 
that were made.

I understand the desire for incremental commits. I can keep it in mind 
in future, with the better understanding of git that I now have. For 
this py3k change, though, the amount of work needed to attempt to 
&quot;unravel&quot; the change and bring it in order is too great for me to want 
to tackle it. The best I can offer is the compromise above.

I could go on - I'll refrain. Hope to hear from you soon.

Thorsten
