<PRE>I've done what I will on the py3k branch. It's been tested on 2.1, 2.2, 
2.7, 3.1 and 3.2.

AllOrNothing unit tests are now in and show AllOrNothing failing 
occasionally. This has always been the case. The unit test just forces 
the failure. Since I highly suspect that no-one actually uses 
AllOrNothing.py - or these errors would have been detected before now - 
I am not going to tackle that particular piece further. Others are more 
than welcome to, of course!

I have updated the documentation that ships with pycrypto, adding 
comments on the (in)security of the algorithms included, such as 
MD2/4/5, SHA1, ARC2, ARC4. Please do have a look. These changes bear 
verification by others. I may well have asserted that which is not true, 
or distorted a fact here and there.

I've issued a pull request. I'm happy to make further changes if there 
should be something I overlooked and that the unit tests did not expose. 
But barring that, I consider the porting effort complete. All further 
work - such as dealing with the errors in AllOrNothing.py and 
random.sample() (the latter is an issue in Python 2.1 only), dealing 
with security concerns in Elgamal.py, deciding the fate of qNEW - I'd 
like to keep to trunk. I've made quite enough changes already on this 
private branch.

Yours
Thorsten
