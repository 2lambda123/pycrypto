Thanks for tolerating my glacial response time. :)

You might want to take a look at a video that tries to explain rebasing.  
Here's one I found:

     <A HREF="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjE3NDI3ODAw.html">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjE3NDI3ODAw.html</A>

If I were rebasing a lot of changes, making substantial changes as I go, 
I'd probably just create a new branch at origin/master and apply individual 
changes (using git cherry-pick -n $COMMIT_ID) to build up a new series of 
commits.  Then, I would do &quot;git diff oldbranch..newbranch&quot; to see what's 
different between them (hopefully nothing).  Also, I usually re-order the 
commits first, compare the resulting branches using &quot;git diff&quot; to make sure 
I didn't miss anything, and *then* make actual code changes.

&gt;<i>I'm not sure what the best way forward is for this part of the changes.  I 
</I>&gt;<i>still think it's cleaner to change the literals than the way asserts and 
</I>&gt;<i>functions are called. b(s) in Py3k returns s.encode(&quot;latin-1&quot;).  Compare 
</I>&gt;<i>and contrast these two:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>input = b'abcdef00'
</I>&gt;<i>expected = b'abcdef00'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>x = somefunction(input)
</I>&gt;<i>assertEqual(x,expected)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>input = 'abcdef00'
</I>&gt;<i>expected = 'cdefab00'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>x = somefunction(input.encode(&quot;latin-1&quot;))
</I>&gt;<i>assertEqual(x,expected.encode(&quot;latin-1&quot;))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you were to write native Py3k code, you'd choose the former over the 
</I>&gt;<i>latter. I tried to get as close to that as I could. I don't quite have 
</I>&gt;<i>b'something', since I can't do that and remain compatible with Python 
</I>&gt;<i>2.x. But the spirit of it is intact: I am changing the way the literal 
</I>&gt;<i>is presented, instead of working with a string literal and changing it 
</I>&gt;<i>to bytes whenever I use it.
</I>
Hmm.  I was puzzled by what you wrote until I saw this:

     &gt;&gt;&gt; import binascii
     &gt;&gt;&gt; binascii.b2a_hex(b&quot;asdf&quot;)
     b'61736466'
     &gt;&gt;&gt;

I would have expected binascii.b2a_hex to return a string, since 
hexadecimal is a human-readable representation of binary data, but 
apparently it doesn't.  Yuck, ok.

&gt;&gt;<i> - References to things like RC5 or IDEA, which have been removed from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     PyCrypto, can be removed.
</I>&gt;<i>I didn't touch those since they may have been there for a reason.
</I>
OK.  It can be done separately later.

&gt;&gt;<i> - If adding additional/alternative dependencies like MPIR, include *why*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that's being done in the commit message and/or in the documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>Hmm, I thought I did. This was done so _fastmath.c would work on 
</I>&gt;<i>Windows. GMP is actively hostile to compilation on Windows. MPIR is a 
</I>&gt;<i>GMP fork that is friendly to compilation on Windows.
</I>
Ok, I guessed that was the reason, but the commit message just said &quot;add 
support for mpir as alternative to gmp&quot;.
