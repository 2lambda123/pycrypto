<PRE>knows how to deal with performance trade-offs, and do not need to be patronized.

Note that we should also define what &quot;too slow&quot; means, 2x? 20x? 50x? What 
would be an acceptable slow-down, provided that we know that by the time
performance has become a problem, the *advanced* user would have already
switched to an optimized library/wrapper?

For instance, the Actionscript crypto library as3crypto is completely written
in AS:

<A HREF="http://crypto.hurlant.com/demo/srcview/">http://crypto.hurlant.com/demo/srcview/</A>

and one positive performance report:

<A HREF="http://drawlogic.com/2008/02/18/as3-cryptography-libraries/">http://drawlogic.com/2008/02/18/as3-cryptography-libraries/</A>

Note the remark &quot;since most of this is client side and only one user would be
using it this is not an issue - server side is where this can have scale problems
from parallel execution but flash is rarely server side if it is too slow,
but it is quite fast&quot;.

&gt;<i> It would also double the cost  
</I>&gt;<i> of maintenance of the library. But a pure python implementation would be  
</I>&gt;<i> convenient for verification of correctness and for documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> purposes.
</I>
Correct, so the cost doesn't double actually. :-)

&gt;<i> (Note: I don't understand your comments about being scriptable and a  
</I>&gt;<i> command-line crypto workbench. That seems to be features related to  
</I>&gt;<i> using Python, independent of which crypto library you use.)
</I>
I don't use often pycrpto for full-blown applications. Instead, I make several
small proof-of-concepts prototypes that help in setting up the final (C-based!)
crypto module of the real application. 

Cheers,

Legrandin
