<PRE>&gt;<i> Well ... you can have your opinion if I (a random user) can have mine ;-)
</I>
I was just throwing my stone into the water... :-)

&gt;<i> Pycrypto does not claim to be a pure-python crypto library. If you  
</I>&gt;<i> expect it to be that then it probably won't meet your expectations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pycrypto _is_ cross-platform, and written in a combination of platform  
</I>&gt;<i> independent C and python, just like Python is.
</I>
My claim goes exactly over the fact that platforms where no suitable
compiler is present or accessible are not supported. Moreover platform
independent C really does not exist (see my previous message).

I don't have real expectations, it is (was) just unclear to me what
the purpose of the library is, and why would one use it. The feeling
I have is that it tries to be used in two camps, without being really
good in any.

&gt;<i> (FWIW, pycrypto _is_  
</I>&gt;<i> partly a &quot;libtomcrypt wrapper&quot;, see  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/doc/#credits.">http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/doc/#credits.</A>) Pycrypto _is_  
</I>&gt;<i> fast. Perhaps not as fast as other optimized libraries are, but it can  
</I>&gt;<i> be used where performance is important.
</I>
Borrowing SHA256 from libtomcrypt does not make it a wrapper to it, first
because it goes only over SHA256, and second future improvements and bugfixes
in libtomcrypt will probably never end up in this local version.

&gt;<i> Some advantages of pycrypto are that it is small, has a simple pythonic  
</I>&gt;<i> API, and don't have any external dependencies. It is not a incomplete  
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper of a huge and complex API (such as the openssl API).
</I>
Agreed, even though it is not clear to me whether you refer to any
existing wrapper. M2crypto seems pretty good for instance.

&gt;<i> Pure python implementations _could_ be added, but they would probably  
</I>&gt;<i> not really be usable. Users getting this slow fallback would probably be  
</I>&gt;<i> annoyed or complain about the performance instead of fixing the problem  
</I>&gt;<i> by installing the right compiled version.
</I>
I saw several times remarks to urge &quot;normal&quot; users not to use pycryto directly
(e.g. RSA schoolbook encryption), but to rely on savier, higher-level code.
