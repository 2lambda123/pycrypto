That sounds good to me, as long as it's not error-prone.  I don't have a 
problem with limiting myself to certain constructs, since I've been doing 
that for Python 2.1 support anyway.

</I>&gt;<i>files.
</I>
Yes, it'll be in a separate branch for now.  As for the specifics, I don't   
know.  Try something and we'll see how it goes.  At some point, I might 
want to refactor it, but we'll deal with that when we have something more 
concrete.
