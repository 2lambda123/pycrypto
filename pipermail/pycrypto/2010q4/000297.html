I don't know.  I was talking about back in 1999 or so when it was the only open source IPsec out there, and a pioneering effort in getting around the US restrictions.  (The open source and mass market exceptions did not yet exist then; it's possible that FreeSWAN along with PGP may have helped bring them into existence.)

Unfortunately I'm not in any position to do that, partly from lack of knowledge and partly because I'm a US person.  And I don't want to come across as objecting to your plan.  My intent was to raise some questions to make sure that the implications were understood.  As you said, it's a mess and hard to make sense of, especially for us non-lawyers.
