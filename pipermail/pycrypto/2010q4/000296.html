Does anybody actually still use FreeS/WAN?

On the other hand, other large projects, like Debian, Ubuntu, Mozilla, 
etc., have integrated crypto into their main distributions.  If the people 
in the Canadian or U.S. government(s) do something stupid with crypto 
export laws, it's not just going to be PyCrypto that's affected.

Oh, I don't know; you're probably right.  One of the painful things about 
this is that I don't have an international traffic-in-arms lawyer on 
retainer.

&gt;&gt;<i> As for the actual regulations, from my perspective, the current Canadian 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and American rules aren't that different from each other, as far as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software &quot;in the public domain&quot; are concerned.  Both countries maintain

I agree; that was the reason that I implemented the no-US-origin policy in 
the first place.  However, I'm tired of turning down good patches from 
people, while not getting patchees from outside the US.  At the current 
rate, Python 3.x support is never going to happen.  *Something* needs to 
change.

&lt;rant&gt;
     You talk about rational processes... *Legislation* is also subject to 
     random change at any time, without any rational process involved.  Look 
     at what's happening with copyright.  Look at how effectively we're 
     dealing with global warming.  Look at software patents, the DMCA, 
     Australian wiretap laws, airport security.

     In democratic countries, the laws are only going to be rational if the 
     people are, so people need to be taught how to think rationally---heck, 
     even to *value* thinking rationally.  Every minute I spend not worrying 
     about where patches come from is a minute that I can spend helping 
     organizations like CFI, EFF, ACLU, RDFRS, and JREF to promote rational, 
     evidence-based reasoning.
&lt;/rant&gt;

If you want to put together a group of non-US people who will actually 
contribute patches of suitable quality, then I'll do what I can to help 
you.  My offer to hand over control of PyCrypto to somebody else still 
stands.[1]

In other words, I agree, but show me the code.

Cheers,
- Dwayne
