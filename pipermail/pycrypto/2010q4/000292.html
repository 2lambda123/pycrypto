Isn't this already the case right now that the regulations are different?  Possibly the *outcome*, for the case of PyCrypto at least, it similar enough, but from what I remember the actual rules are quite different.

It seems to me a bit like taking a BSD-licensed project and deciding to accept GPL-licensed contributions.  The result is still open source but it does makea  difference.

In this case, it seems to me you're changing PyCrypto from a project that is NOT &quot;subject to the EAL&quot; (the U.S. Export regulations) to one that is.  Are you sure you want to do that?
