<PRE>Can block cipher chaining modes be implemented in Python without making 
ridiculous performance sacrifices?  I'm not a Python performance expert, 
but I thought the Python function call overhead was too high.

</I>&gt;<i>implementation included from some
</I>&gt;<i>good patent-free library (e.g. tomcrypt) and shipped. So much time saved...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Protocols are another beast though: key derivation/management/exchange
</I>&gt;<i>schemes, wrappers,
</I>&gt;<i>message authentication codes, etc etc are in most cases independent of
</I>&gt;<i>the underlying cipher/hash
</I>&gt;<i>primitive and can be more cleanly and quickly implemented/tested in a
</I>&gt;<i>high-level language like Python
</I>&gt;<i>with little performance penalty. PKCS#1 and PBKDF2 are good examples.
</I>&gt;<i>Even chaining modes
</I>&gt;<i>for block ciphers look better in python (to me at least).I would
</I>&gt;<i>really prefer to have these high-level
</I>&gt;<i>algorithms available in the library and not through some obscure
</I>&gt;<i>openssl-like library coded in C...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My 2 cents... :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Going through the bug tracker and the mailing list, a lot of the requests
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are to add new algorithms (Camellia, SHA512, TEA, PKCS#1/OAEP, PBKDF2), or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to make changes to the existing implementations (timing attack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> countermeasures for the AES module, better prime generation for RSA).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They're all good ideas, but I don't have the time or the expertise needed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to review C implementations of low-level crypto primitives, and frankly, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have better things to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Python does not need its own custom AES implementation.  Neither do Java,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ruby, Perl, JavaScript, PHP, Go, C++, D, Clojure, Haskell.  It's a waste of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> volunteer time, it's bad engineering, and it means that the FOSS community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ends up repeating the same mistakes over and over, year after year, every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time a new language comes out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm putting a stop to it.  I'm declaring a permanent feature freeze on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C implementations of &lt;Crypto.Cipher.*&gt; and &lt;Crypto.Hash.*&gt;.  New algortihms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be added only by calling out to existing libraries.  PyCrypto
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development will be focused on the API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't yet figured out exactly how this is going to look.  I'm thinking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of some kind of pluggable backends, sort of like how Java or CryptoAPI, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with as little API complexity as possible.  Ideas are welcome.
