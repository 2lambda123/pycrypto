<PRE>Small notes.

&gt;<i> Yeah, it's a nice architecture.  Unfortunately, it also requires that

</I>
That seems like a good choice. Those of us who want crypto code that
comes from C have many other ways of getting it.

&gt;<i> My thoughts mirror the ideas presented in D. J. Bernstein's paper, &quot;Some
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf">http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf</A>&gt;.  I encourage everyone here to
</I>&gt;<i> read it, if you have not already.
</I>
A strong &quot;me too&quot; on having everyone read that paper.

&gt;<i> Which algorithms are you referring to?  Just MD2?  I'm willing to drop MD2
</I>&gt;<i> if there are no objections.  I'm not going to be removing MD5 or SHA-1 any
</I>&gt;<i> time soon; They're just wrappers around the Python standard library anyway.
</I>
The idea of dropping support for &quot;weak&quot; algorithms is silly. No
developer looks through the list of algorithms in a library and say
&quot;I'll pick, um, er, that one&quot; without knowing what it is. There is no
security problem with a library having weak algorithms, only with
clueless people using them without understanding the consequences.
Old, weak hash algorithms are still needed for validating old
signatures and certificates.

&gt;&gt;<i> With respect to the recommendations of the NIST and others I propose to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offer the following algorithm additionally and directly over the distributed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> library interface: SHA-224, SHA-256 (C file is allready included), SHA-384,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SHA-512, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-256, RIPEMD-320, Tiger and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WHIRLPOOL.
</I>
Just a note on that sentence: NIST only recommends the members of the
SHA family; all the rest are recommended by &quot;and others&quot;.

&gt;<i> My understanding is that SHA-224 and SHA-384 are encumbered by software
</I>&gt;<i> patents
</I>
The entire SHA-2 family is encumbered by a patent (US 6,829,355) that
is licensed royalty-free (see
&lt;<A HREF="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/858/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/858/</A>&gt;). It applies to SHA-256 and
SHA-512 as well.

&gt;<i> and provide no performance advantages over SHA-256 and SHA-512,
</I>&gt;<i> respectively.
</I>
Quite true.
