Really?  Many developers still use MD5 in new applications.

Overly optimistic developers (or their micro-managing bosses) routinely 
make design choices favouring speed or portability over security, and it's 
the _users_ who suffer the consequences.  Following your line of reasoning, 
there was nothing wrong with RandomPool; It was simply being misused---by 
practically everyone.  I disagree, and RandomPool is now deprecated.

Many airplane crashes can be written off as &quot;pilot error&quot;, but often there 
are other factors involved, and investigators owe it to the _passengers_ to 
discover those factors and take steps to avoid similar situations in the 
future.  The same thing applied to crypto libraries.

&gt;<i>Old, weak hash algorithms are still needed for validating old signatures 
</I>&gt;<i>and certificates.
</I>
Agreed.  Even if the MD5 or SHA-1 libraries weren't wrappers around the 
Python standard library, I still would not remove them, since that would 
break nearly every program that uses PyCrypto, I would think.  Having said 
that, does anybody using PyCrypto actually need MD2, specifically?  Having 
less code makes PyCrypto more maintainable, and I'm not opposed to removing 
what is basically &quot;dead code&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> With respect to the recommendations of the NIST and others I propose to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> offer the following algorithm additionally and directly over the distributed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> library interface: SHA-224, SHA-256 (C file is allready included), SHA-384,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SHA-512, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-256, RIPEMD-320, Tiger and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> WHIRLPOOL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Just a note on that sentence: NIST only recommends the members of the
</I>&gt;<i>SHA family; all the rest are recommended by &quot;and others&quot;.
</I>
Thank you for clarifying that point.

&gt;&gt;<i> My understanding is that SHA-224 and SHA-384 are encumbered by software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patents
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The entire SHA-2 family is encumbered by a patent (US 6,829,355) that
</I>&gt;<i>is licensed royalty-free (see
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;<A HREF="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/858/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/858/</A>&gt;). It applies to SHA-256 and
</I>&gt;<i>SHA-512 as well.
</I>
If it's licensed to everyone on an automatic, royalty-free basis, then it's 
not _encumbered_ by a patent, just _covered_ by a patent.  Practically 
everything is covered by patents.  What I am concerned about is people 
actually getting sued (especially successfully) for patent infringement.

My understanding was that SHA-224 and SHA-384 had additional patent 
encumbrances that are did not apply to SHA-256 and SHA-512.  That 
understanding probably came from Wikipedia, and it may be incorrect.

In any case, SHA-224 and SHA-384 are just weakened versions of SHA-256 and 
SHA-512, so I'm not inclined to add them without good reason.

Thanks for the feedback,
  - Dwayne
