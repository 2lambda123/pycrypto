&gt;<i> Really?  Many developers still use MD5 in new applications.
</I>
MD5 is still perfectly usable in applications that do not rely on the
collision resistance and only need 128 bits of preimage resistance.
For example, HMAC-MD5 has been proven to be secure even is the
collision resistance is near zero. A hashed signature algorithm can
use MD5 with no problems.

</I>
If someone knows enough about MD5 to know that it is faster than
SHA-1, or that it is more portable than SHA-1, knows about its
properties enough to use it.

If you really want the library to be in nanny mode, simply rename the
function from &quot;MD5&quot; to something like &quot;idontwantyoutouseMD5&quot;. This is
a serious suggestion. Self-documenting function names are surprisingly
useful.

&gt;<i> Following your line of reasoning,
</I>&gt;<i> there was nothing wrong with RandomPool; It was simply being misused---by
</I>&gt;<i> practically everyone.  I disagree, and RandomPool is now deprecated.
</I>
That is not my line of reasoning. RandomPool was unsafe at any speed.
MD5 is safe for many purposes.

&gt;<i> If it's licensed to everyone on an automatic, royalty-free basis, then it's
</I>&gt;<i> not _encumbered_ by a patent, just _covered_ by a patent.
</I>
Some pedants would not slice and dice it that way.

&gt;<i> My understanding was that SHA-224 and SHA-384 had additional patent
</I>&gt;<i> encumbrances that are did not apply to SHA-256 and SHA-512.  That
</I>&gt;<i> understanding probably came from Wikipedia, and it may be incorrect.
</I>
I see nothing in the current version of the Wikipedia page that says
that, and I have never heard of any such encumbrances. If there were,
the NSA would be amazingly remiss in filing an IPR statement with the
IETF for the family as a whole but not those members.

&gt;<i> In any case, SHA-224 and SHA-384 are just weakened versions of SHA-256 and
</I>&gt;<i> SHA-512, so I'm not inclined to add them without good reason.
</I>
I am not a proponent of either function, but I can channel those who
are. SHA-224 is designed to have &quot;matched impedance&quot; with TripleDES,
which has 112 bits of strength. Similarly, SHA-384 is matched to
AES-196. I find the impedance idea goofy, but some folks like it.
