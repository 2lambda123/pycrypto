<PRE>Hi,

I've just been trying to figure out why some code of mine broke after an
update from 2.0.1 to 2.6.1, and found that I hadn't been passing an IV into
AES.new() (using MODE_CFB).

Previously, it was happy with this, and, according to the docs here (
<A HREF="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/">https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/</A>), &quot;It is optional and
when not present it will be given a default value of all zeroes.&quot;

Looking at the code that throws the exception (
<A HREF="https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/blob/master/src/block_template.c,">https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/blob/master/src/block_template.c,</A> line
163), it doesn't allow for doing what the docs suggest it will.

I'm not sure whether I've either misunderstood something or which of the
two is wrong, but I thought I'd at least flag it for discussion...


Hugh
