</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I've always had a good experience with Cython. What do you thinkg about

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Anyway, as long as we are not starting to use ctypes, I'll be fine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Depending on the timeframe of this change, I'd prefer PyCrypto to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;someting that does not require hacks in binary distributions. If cffi is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;fixed until the change happens, I won't complain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ctypes is definitely not on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From what I understand, CFFI will only try to build binaries if
</I>&gt;<i> they're not already found.  I think as long as packages that use
</I>&gt;<i> CFFI include the appropriate rules in their `setup.py build_ext`
</I>&gt;<i> process, it shouldn't be a problem.  (I'd certainly work with you to
</I>&gt;<i> make sure the packaging isn't a nightmare.)
</I>
cffi 0.8 has been released in the meantime. I hope the issues have been
fixed, but I haven't had the time to check out the new version.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;4. What if Crypto.* became a wrapper around some other crypto library?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This depends on the crypto library you're thinking of. If it's openssl,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;then all the GPL licensed reverse dependencies might have a problem (at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;least in Debian).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;5. The Apache License 2.0.  What if PyCrypto were licensed under it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;or    included dependencies that are licensed under it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;With my Debian maintainer hat on, this would be a problem for me. We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;still ship software that is GPL 2 only that depends on PyCrypto.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;However, GPL 2 and the Apache License 2.0 are incompatible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Examples of these packages include revelation and pymsnt (I stopped
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;searching for GPL 2 only reverse dependencies after I've found two).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Of course, if the license changes or python-crypto starts depending on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;something licensed under Apache 2.0 this needs to be checked on a case by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;case basis, but I'd rather avoid it if there is no really good reason to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;do so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ugh, GPL 2 only.  I wish people would at least do &quot;or any later
</I>&gt;<i> version&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking of merging with the folks at <A HREF="https://cryptography.io/,">https://cryptography.io/,</A>
</I>&gt;<i> which is covered by an Apache 2.0 license.
</I>
What is the merge going to look like?

&gt;<i> How bad is the situation with GPL2-only packages?
</I>
I'll check the reverse dependencies in a couple of days.
