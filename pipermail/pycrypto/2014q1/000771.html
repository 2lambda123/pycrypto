ctypes is definitely not on the list.

 From what I understand, CFFI will only try to build binaries if they're 
not already found.  I think as long as packages that use CFFI include 
the appropriate rules in their `setup.py build_ext` process, it 
shouldn't be a problem.  (I'd certainly work with you to make sure the 
packaging isn't a nightmare.)

&gt;&gt;<i> 4. What if Crypto.* became a wrapper around some other crypto library?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This depends on the crypto library you're thinking of. If it's openssl,
</I>&gt;<i>then all the GPL licensed reverse dependencies might have a problem (at
</I>&gt;<i>least in Debian).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>Examples of these packages include revelation and pymsnt (I stopped

</I>&gt;<i>Of course, if the license changes or python-crypto starts depending on

Ugh, GPL 2 only.  I wish people would at least do &quot;or any later 
version&quot;.

I'm thinking of merging with the folks at <A HREF="https://cryptography.io/,">https://cryptography.io/,</A> 
which is covered by an Apache 2.0 license.  My concern is that there are 
a really small number of good crypto implementers in the FOSS world, and 
we're all working on different projects, so Linus' Law isn't really 
taking effect, to the detriment of our users.

With the increase in direct, state-sponsored attacks on deployed 
cryptosystems, there's a renewed interest in deploying &quot;crypto 
everywhere&quot;, but our APIs are all terrible, our implementations are 
questionable, our protocols are error-prone.  I feel that we really need 
to combine our efforts if we want to have any hope of fixing these 
problems so that application developers can provide real security to us 
all.  If it means cutting loose a few rarely-used GPL2-only packages, it 
might be worth it.

How bad is the situation with GPL2-only packages?
