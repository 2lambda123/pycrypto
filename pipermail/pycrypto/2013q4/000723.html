<PRE>Hi Dwayne and everyone,

&gt;<i>1. How many of you would really care if PyCrypto 2.6 was that last
</I>&gt;<i>    version to support legacy versions of Python?  By &quot;legacy&quot;, I mean
</I>&gt;<i>   all versions of Python that are NOT one of these:
</I>
&gt;<i>     - Python 2.6.x
</I>&gt;<i>     - Python 2.7.x
</I>&gt;<i>    - Python 3.3 and above.
</I>
&gt;<i>    I'd continue to make bugfix releases of PyCrypto 2.6.x, but add no
</I>&gt;<i>    more substantial new features.
</I>
+1 for that, assuming it will make other efforts in PyCrypto easier.

&gt;<i>2. I'm thinking of pulling in additional dependencies (e.g. cffi),
</I>&gt;<i>    requiring setuptools, and basically joining what the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i>   Python community is doing in 2013.
</I>
Like people said before me, it seems very immature, and Cython is not a bad
alternative at all.
There is a lot of know how out there with Cython. I would be willing to
help with the efforts.


&gt;<i>3. What if src/*.c were removed, and any relevant C code moved into an
</I>&gt;<i>    independent library, which could be loaded using cffi?  (This is
</I>&gt;<i>   basically what we need to do to support PyPy properly.)
</I>
An independent library, sounds good. But it seems that Cython supports pypy
too.

&gt;<i>4. What if Crypto.* became a wrapper around some other crypto library?
</I>
Why ? what is the benefit here?

&gt;<i>5. The Apache License 2.0.  What if PyCrypto were licensed under it, or
</I>&gt;<i>    included dependencies that are licensed under it?
</I>
As the maintainer of a small project and humble project (pwman3) that uses
pycrypto, and it is
licensed unde GPL I would have a problem with it. I think the better choice
would be LGPL, as said
also before me.

I would love to have support for pypi, pip and setuptools, until now
installing pycrypto
was always a pain.

Best Regards,
Oz
