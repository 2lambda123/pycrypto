<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. How many of you would really care if PyCrypto 2.6 was that last
</I>&gt;<i> version to support legacy versions of Python?  By &quot;legacy&quot;, I mean    all
</I>&gt;<i> versions of Python that are NOT one of these:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Python 2.6.x
</I>&gt;<i>     - Python 2.7.x
</I>&gt;<i>     - Python 3.3 and above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I'd continue to make bugfix releases of PyCrypto 2.6.x, but add no
</I>&gt;<i> more substantial new features.
</I>
That would be the wisest decision.
It is fair to say that there are a lot of production servers and
embedded platforms out there that are stuck to something as old as
Python 2.4, but they are hardly target for new developments. A
bugfixed PyCrypto 2.6.x is probably good enough for them.

&gt;<i> 2. I'm thinking of pulling in additional dependencies (e.g. cffi),
</I>&gt;<i> requiring setuptools, and basically joining what the rest of the    Python
</I>&gt;<i> community is doing in 2013.
</I>
cffi is awesome. Is it friendly to cross-compile environments though?
That's rather important (to me at least).
For the same reason, I would be happy if autoconf was removed.

&gt;<i> 3. What if src/*.c were removed, and any relevant C code moved into an
</I>&gt;<i> independent library, which could be loaded using cffi?  (This is
</I>&gt;<i> basically what we need to do to support PyPy properly.)
</I>
If by &quot;independent&quot; you mean a library not packaged with pycrypto,
then it would be bad. One of the strong points of pycrypto is that it
is self-contained.

If you mean that C code is compiled into a library which is not a
python module as today, then it does not make any difference unless
the build becomes more complicated.

&gt;<i> 4. What if Crypto.* became a wrapper around some other crypto library?
</I>
I would probably stop using pycrypto. There are already M2Crypto,
pycryptopp and a bunch of others. They are good enough and battle
tested. There is no need for another one.

&gt;<i> 5. The Apache License 2.0.  What if PyCrypto were licensed under it, or
</I>&gt;<i> included dependencies that are licensed under it?
</I>
To me, it wouldn't make much difference.

&gt;<i> 6. What if src/*.c was mostly replaced with mostly just went away.
</I>
I don't understand this statement.

&gt;<i> I'm beginning to wonder how the risk of downstream forks compares to the
</I>&gt;<i> risks that users face when developers still don't have a highly-visible,
</I>&gt;<i> easy-to-use Python crypto API.
</I>
The pycryto API is already easy to use actually and it has the right
level of abstraction (=medium/low).
The main criticism one can move is that there are several booby traps
that a first-time user will surely trip on.

&gt;<i> It might be better to merge PyCrypto with
</I>&gt;<i> one or more other Python crypto libraries...
</I>
&quot;Merge with&quot; as in &quot;become a facade for&quot; ?
I would stop using pycrypto too and just use to the other library.
