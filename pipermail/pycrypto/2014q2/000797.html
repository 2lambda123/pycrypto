<PRE>
Since the libgmp on our Linux server (SLES11SP2) has a known vulnerability, I'm trying to build pycrypto against the latest libgmp that I have installed in an alternate location and have the run path set so that it picks up the alternate libgmp without having to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  First, I tried modifying include_dirs, library_dirs and runtime_library_dirs in the setup.py.  When that didn't work, I tried only setting CFLAGS/CPPFLAGS/LDFLAGS environment variables.  Neither worked.  In both cases, I see my compiler and linker flags on the command lines, but because &quot;-L/usr/lib64 -L/lib64&quot; always appears first, the library is linked against the system libgmp and not the alternate one.  At this point, my only solution is to build the _fastmath.so and then re-run the link command without the &quot;-L/usr/lib64 -L/lib64&quot; arguments.  Isn't there a cleaner way to accomplish what I need ?  Why don't my LDFLAGS appear first on the link line ?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you.
