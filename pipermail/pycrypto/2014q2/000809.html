<PRE>It's not dead.  Due to some personal issues, I just have very little 
time to work on the project right now, and unfortunately I haven't been 
able to find someone I trust to hand off maintenance to.  It seems that 
most contributors either want to add their pet algorithms[1] (increasing 
maintenance overhead)]---or they introduce potentially serious 
vulnerabilities[2][3], bizarre[4] or inconsistent[5] APIs, performance 
issues, etc.

That's fine; Crypto is hard, but it means progress is slow, because I 
have to go over everything with a fine-toothed comb, and it's hard to 
find the time do it, and I'm reluctant to merge code that might make 
things worse for existing end-users, even if this makes some developers 
unhappy.

If a fork is necessary, Sebastian Ramacher is probably the person I 
trust the most---at the moment---to maintain it.  His patches have been 
consistently good, albeit small, and he's the Debian package maintainer, 
so a lot of people are already implicitly relying on him anyway.

I'm hoping to spend more time on the project soon, but my availability 
is hard to predict in advance.  Hopefully, things will be better in the 
next 6-12 months, but I can't promise anything.

In the meantime, there are a few things that might help in the short 
term:

- Having some process for triage &amp; code review, so that the community 
   can vet and patches, and also ensure that the master branch remains in 
   a releasable state.  Right now, I have an unordered set of pull 
   requests to deal with.  It would be great if this became a queue that 
   was prioritized according to quality and the current release goals.

- CI infrastructure.  It would be really helpful if all pull requests 
   were automatically tested against.  Like [6], but actually covering 
   all currently supported configurations.

- Moving bug tracking to GitHub (from Launchpad).  Using both tools has 
   been pretty cumbersome, but I've been reluctant to disrupt things.  
   Any objections to this?

- If anyone is in/near San Francisco and wants to help with this, it 
   might help if we introduced ourselves in person.

Does anyone want to champion this?

Regards,
- Dwayne

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Every now and then, I can read on the ML proposals and intentions for

</I>&gt;<i>translate into anything solid. Worse than that, their completion is set as

</I>&gt;<i>What can be done to improve on that?
</I>&gt;<i>Would setting up a tip jar help?
</I>&gt;<i>Would a fork of the library be seen as hostile?

</I>&gt;<i>Finally, I am aware of the existence of the cryptography project [1].
