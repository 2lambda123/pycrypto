<PRE>I've insufficient knowledge to tweak code.
I do believe the documentation could be improved.
How to split out the documentation into n parts,
at least one favouring usage, examples, testing etc.
If I believed the list/site was live, I would work on that
and submit it for review.
 The requirement surely is to document fully the API, but
also provide ... a guidance /usage document set?

Getting no response from the maintainer is not conducive to submitting anything?



regards

</I>&gt;<i> bizarre[4] or inconsistent[5] APIs, performance issues, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's fine; Crypto is hard, but it means progress is slow, because I have

</I>&gt;<i> time do it, and I'm reluctant to merge code that might make things worse for
</I>&gt;<i> existing end-users, even if this makes some developers unhappy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a fork is necessary, Sebastian Ramacher is probably the person I trust
</I>&gt;<i> the most---at the moment---to maintain it.  His patches have been
</I>&gt;<i> consistently good, albeit small, and he's the Debian package maintainer, so
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of people are already implicitly relying on him anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hoping to spend more time on the project soon, but my availability is
</I>&gt;<i> hard to predict in advance.  Hopefully, things will be better in the next
</I>&gt;<i> 6-12 months, but I can't promise anything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, there are a few things that might help in the short term:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Having some process for triage &amp; code review, so that the community   can
</I>&gt;<i> vet and patches, and also ensure that the master branch remains in   a
</I>&gt;<i> releasable state.  Right now, I have an unordered set of pull   requests to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with.  It would be great if this became a queue that   was prioritized
</I>&gt;<i> according to quality and the current release goals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - CI infrastructure.  It would be really helpful if all pull requests   were
</I>&gt;<i> automatically tested against.  Like [6], but actually covering   all
</I>&gt;<i> currently supported configurations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Moving bug tracking to GitHub (from Launchpad).  Using both tools has
</I>&gt;<i> been pretty cumbersome, but I've been reluctant to disrupt things.    Any
</I>&gt;<i> objections to this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - If anyone is in/near San Francisco and wants to help with this, it   might
</I>&gt;<i> help if we introduced ourselves in person.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone want to champion this?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If one had to judge from the speed security flaws are recognized,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fixed and disclosed [1], then no, pycrypto is definitely not dead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Other, more active FOSS library should take notes in fact.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, when it comes to adding new features (as in, catching up with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs of a normal security application in 2014) and refactoring the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing ones, pycrypto is deep frozen. Bug reports keep piling up and it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can easily take a couple of years for a pull request to finally end up in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Every now and then, I can read on the ML proposals and intentions for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> major (and IMO, not entirely needed) overhauls, but they never seem to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> translate into anything solid. Worse than that, their completion is set as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> precondition for acceptance of any new feature, which further exacerbates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What can be done to improve on that?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would setting up a tip jar help?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would a fork of the library be seen as hostile?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, I am aware of the existence of the cryptography project [1].
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It does *not* cover my needs and I do *not* agree with some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> principles and motivations behind that design, though its dev and test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processes are clearly sound.
