<PRE>&gt;<i> Since the libgmp on our Linux server (SLES11SP2) has a known vulnerability
</I>&gt;<i> , I'm trying to build pycrypto against the latest libgmp that I have installed
</I>&gt;<i>  in an alternate location and have the run path set so that it picks up the
</I>&gt;<i> alternate libgmp without having to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  First, I tried
</I>&gt;<i> modifying include_dirs, library_dirs and runtime_library_dirs in the setup.py.
</I>&gt;<i> When that didn't work, I tried only setting CFLAGS/CPPFLAGS/LDFLAGS
</I>&gt;<i> environment variables.  Neither worked.  In both cases, I see my compiler
</I>&gt;<i> and linker flags on the command lines, but because &quot;-L/usr/lib64 -L/lib64&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> always appears first, the library is linked against the system libgmp and not
</I>&gt;<i> the alternate one.  At this point, my only solution is to build the _fastmath.so
</I>&gt;<i> and then re-run the link command without the &quot;-L/usr/lib64 -L/lib64&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> arguments.  Isn't there a cleaner way to accomplish what I need ?  Why don't
</I>&gt;<i> my LDFLAGS appear first on the link line ?  Any help would be appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.
</I>

Please disregard my posting.  I only see this behavior in Python 2.7.5, so it's either the Python package or the version of distribute/setuptools that is shipped with that specific Python version.  I tried building against a different libgmp with other Python 2.7.X versions and none of them are prepending those system libraries to the link line.
