Subject: [pycrypto] What needs to happen to have a 2.7 release?
Message-ID: <1455106660-sup-6795@personal>

Hello,

I need an AES GCM implementation for some free software I'm coding (See
Backstory). Currently there is no native AES GCM implementation for python
besides the last alpha(?) 2.7a1 of pycrypto and PyCryptodome (See About
PyCryptodome). What needs to be done so a new release can happen? 

# Backstory: 
In my free time I'm working on a Gajim-OMEMO Plugin[1]. OMEMO[2] is an XMPP
Extension Protocol (XEP) for secure multi-client end-to-end encryption. It is an
open standard based on Axolotl.

Currently I use a python 2 implementation of GCM which is pretty slow, but there
is practically no alternative, so this implementation gets reused in i.e
http-upload Gajim plugin.

# About PyCryptodome
While PyCryptodome provides an AES GCM implementation, it is not an alternative
because it uses the same namespace as pycrypto. I have to make sure that
everything *else* on what I depend and what depends on my projects,  migrates to
PyCryptodome (Gajim, python-axolotl, gajim-otr-plugin, ...). Even if all the
software is migrated to PyCryptodome, there are still a lot of issues to solve,
like what if the user installs/needs pycrypto?

Message-ID: <8C5A9CDE05BAB24BA51DE3523203252D123E164A@ORSMSX106.amr.corp.intel.com>

Hi,

Are there any existing plans to integrate the AEAD algorithm ChaCha20-Poly1305 into pycrypto? It has as similar use case in IPSec as AES-GCM, which I have been using in the 2.7a1 experimental release.

Thanks,
Dan Collins

Actually, with "pip install pycryptodomex" you get the exact same code
installed in the separate "Cryptodome" package.

Subject: [pycrypto] issue with redefine of malloc to rpl_malloc on AIX,
 also hint re: _LARGE_FILES as a CFLAG define
Message-ID: <732860a5-7b15-6733-6444-400979ee1fc8@felt.demon.nl>

Hi - A couple things.
Show stopper was this message: ld: 0711-317 ERROR: Undefined symbol: 
.rpl_malloc
The fist thing I find via google:"ld: 0711-317 ERROR: Undefined symbol: 
.rpl_malloc AIX" is: https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/1321757
and the second starts here: 
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2012-11/msg00078.html

* The key message for coreutils being: 
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2012-11/msg00089.html 
where he suggests to add an #undef malloc

* Back to the first find - more in your domain: the poster suggests 
effectively the same - except I expect src/config.h is generated so it 
will never stay.

* re: the command below: -std=c99 is a GCC thing (and every compile has 
a warning about an incorrect argument for -t being ignored)

xlc_r -D_LARGE_FILES -std=c99 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -Isrc/ 
-I/opt/include/python2.7 -c src/AES.c -o build/temp.aix-5.3-2.7/src/AES.o
  Adding the -bloadmap:xxx.map gives these key lines in the .map output

Once the #undefine is set one way or another, it builds (outside of pip).

FYI: There are several other errors that occur when _LARGE_FILES is not 
defined. (export CFLAGS="-D_LARGE_FILES" takes care of that).
While someone building on AIX should know this and 'fix' it on the 
command-line, having it added to the config for AIX would be great.

Info:
_LARGE_FLAGS is the 'constuct' or 'define' that IBM established for 
ensuring support for LARGE_FILES regardless of the
kernel/application ABI size and predates anything GNU came up with by 
several years. As your module is sensitive for this
I recommend you have a way to add it to the flags - because to work - 
this should be defined before any other system include files are
read (i.e., they all need to know from the start). Behavior is undefined 
when this advice aka rule is not followed.

Also note: extract from ./configure output:
checking for stdlib.h... (cached) yes
checking for GNU libc compatible malloc... no
checking for memmove... yes
checking for memset... yes
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating src/config.h

root at x064:[/data/prj/aixtools/saltstack/pycrypto-2.6.1]grep malloc 
src/config.h
/* Define to 1 if your system has a GNU libc compatible `malloc' 
function, and
/* Define to rpl_malloc if the replacement function should be used. */
#define malloc rpl_malloc

So, it seems the logic for "GNU compatible" is followed (nothing is defined)
but the define malloc rpl_malloc occurs regardless.

consider Helder Eijs' "PyCryptodome" as a replacement. More information:

I downloaded and built from source which seems to work fine.
Shame really, it's a good library.

Consider the following rather basic but important bug in pycrypto:

https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/issues/187

As you'll see there, I stumbled on it and even built a fixed version a few
months ago.

Revisiting this now, I just re-tested to see that pycryptodome already has
that fix in it.

Your mileage may vary, but pycryptodome is being actively developed and
maintained and is a drop-in replacement for pycrypto.

Thanks for that. Good it's installable via pip.
I've a whole setup (pwd safe) to check out, I'll
see if it sits as a usable replacement.

Since it's forked from pycrypto 2.6.1 I think you'll be fine. However, if
you find places where it falls short versus this one, please open an issue
with them first so it can be tracked and hopefully rectified, and reply
with the bug link here so others can be aware of it.

# pip search pycryptodome
pycryptodome (3.4.3)   - Cryptographic library for Python
pycryptodomex (3.4.3)  - Cryptographic library for Python

What's the difference please?

Typo, or two packages of the same exact name?

The system shouldn't have a problem uninstalling the RPM because of the
way these packages get installed - pycryptodome uses the same package name
"Crypto", but it's not installed in the same folders. Because of that same
namespace, with both installed it can be a toss-up as to which package
named "Crypto" Python will use.

pycryptodomex uses a different package name entirely ("Cryptodome") - thus
it wouldn't conflict with "Crypto", but you'd have to refactor everything
to use "Cryptodome" instead which is its own kind of pain.

Since pycryptodome is a superset of pycrypto, there shouldn't be anything
missing (and it already works better just by virtue of the bugs that got
fixed), thus using that alone ought to suffice.

Additional information.

 pip install pycryptodomex
Requirement already satisfied: pycryptodomex in
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages


Yet...

 File "/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/Crypto/Cipher/blockalgo.py",
line 141, in __init__
    self._cipher = factory.new(key, *args, **kwargs)
ValueError: IV must be 16 bytes long

So (since I'm using python3) it's picking up the Crypto library from python 3.5
and pip is installing it in python 2.7

https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html#windows-from-sources-python-3-5-and-newer

(aside. Yum no longer used in Fedora, just replace with dnf)

python3 -m Cryptodome.Selftest
/usr/bin/python3: Error while finding spec for 'Cryptodome.Selftest'
(ImportError: No module named 'Cryptodome')

When you run `pip2.7 list` (pretty sure that's what you need for python2,
or `pip list` may be the defacto python2 pip on Fedora) and `pip3.5 list`
(for python3), what are you seeing in the area of "pycrypto*" for each of
these? I'm hopeful that once you have the proper libs installed for
python3 via pip3.5 things should work better.

Normally you'd use the pip variant for python3 (e.g., pip3.5) to install
packages for python3. Can you give that a look and retry?

Note that I'm not an expert on pycryptodome - my understanding is that
pycryptodome can be used instead of pycrypto, and it seems to work fine on
Windows (and I don't have reason to think it'd be any different on Linux).
I have no experience with pycryptodomex currently. I have pycryptodome
installed on python 2.7 and 3.5 on my Windows box (and pycrypto NOT
installed on either) and the test you described ran fine for both.

That said, if this continues, what version of Fedora are you running? I
can stand up a VM and see for myself.

Followup: I ran the following tests - note that I did NOT have pycrypto
installed at any point in this process for either Python.

It's not necessary to install BOTH pycryptodome and pycryptodomex... this,
too, was simply for the sake of this test. Either pycryptodome instead of
pycrypto, or pycryptodomex and lots of code refactoring, will do the job.

# Installed Fedora 25 server in a VM, default options

# Logged in as admin user (or root)

sudo dnf install redhat-rpm-config gcc gmp python-devel python3-devel
# Fedora 25 already comes with python3.5
# `python-devel` above installs python2.7, which is desirable for this test


# Note: The following is for testing purposes - it's typically wise to
install packages locally lest you cause system-wide problems.

# Ignore `pip` version upgrade warnings

sudo pip3.5 install pycryptodome
sudo pip2.7 install pycryptodome

python2.7 -m Crypto.SelfTest
python3.5 -m Crypto.SelfTest

sudo pip3.5 install pycryptodomex
sudo pip2.7 install pycryptodomex

python2.7 -m Cryptodome.SelfTest
python3.5 -m Cryptodome.SelfTest

## All tests passed.

# Doublecheck:

pip3.5 list | grep pycrypt
#    pycryptodome (3.4.3)
#    pycryptodomex (3.4.3)

pip2.7 list | grep pycrypt
#    pycryptodome (3.4.3)
#    pycryptodomex (3.4.3)

# Note we do NOT see `pycrypto` anywhere!

pip2 list | grep crypt
pycryptodomex (3.4.3)


No such thing as pip3.x

Looks like python3-pip is pip?

Yet

# pip -V
pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)


So (possibly?) there is a pip looking at python3.

Latest - Fedora 25.

Is there a separate mailing list for pycryptodome?
Perhaps I should ask there?

Tks. Dave

Subtle. Seems access to pip 3 is via

# python3 -m pip list | grep crypto
DEPRECATION: The default format will switch to columns in the future.
You can use --format=(legacy|columns) (or define a
format=(legacy|columns) in your pip.conf under the [list] section) to
disable this warning.
pycrypto (2.6.1)


So 3 seems to have pycrypto 2.6.1... maybe.

regards

This is beyond the scope of pycrypto for the moment - you have system
problems because you've upgraded pip yourself.

This looks familiar because I did the same exact thing myself in the
process of testing this (and it didn't go smoothly - same problem you're
having - so I rolled that back to get pip2 and pip3 working properly).
Let's get you back on track.

# At this point let's get back to the system default pips and go from
there. IF you upgraded the system pip to 9.0.1 as it appears, here's how
to fix them:

sudo dnf reinstall python-pip python3-pip

# Now, with that done, run these:
sudo pip3.5 uninstall pycrypto
sudo pip2.7 uninstall pycrypto

# Once that's done, list them as per my earlier email:
pip3.5 list | grep pycrypt
pip2.7 list | grep pycrypt

Shouldn't see `pycrypto` there now. If you do... you installed it some
other way (perhaps as a dnf package?) Uninstall it via the same mechanism
you installed it and try again.

Now go through the steps in my previous email to install pycryptodome and
pycryptodomex for the purpose of this test, and report the results.

OK

produces
# pip3.5 uninstall pycrypto
DEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (pycrypto) has
been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due
to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially
uninstall the project.
Uninstalling pycrypto-2.6.1:
  /usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/pycrypto-2.6.1-py3.5.egg-info
Proceed (y/n)?

"distutils installed project" - will only partially uninstall the project?
Unclear just what that means.
Accept y and get a pip warning!

Proceed (y/n)? y
  Successfully uninstalled pycrypto-2.6.1
You are using pip version 8.1.2, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.


Ignored the message


> sudo pip2.7 uninstall pycrypto

Ah! A difference.
#pip2.7 uninstall pycrypto
Cannot uninstall requirement pycrypto, not installed
You are using pip version 8.1.2, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.

It would seem that pycrypto (installed using python setup.py install) is
"associated" with python 2.7 (guess)

Either way it is uninstalled.

Nothing from pip3.5

however

# pip2.7 list | grep pycrypt
pycryptodomex (3.4.3)

so that is there.

Which I did yesterday, using the suggestion from a link
https://ofswiki.org/wiki/Uninstalling_setup.py_install

Both? IFAICT the suggestion is one or the other, both not needed?


Aside, I am not 'out of date' with pip
# pip3.5 -V
pip 8.1.2 from /usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)

# pip2.7 -V
pip 8.1.2 from /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)



OK, to repeat the tests from the pycryptodome pages.

# python3 -m Cryptodome.SelfTest
/usr/bin/python3: Error while finding spec for 'Cryptodome.SelfTest'
(ImportError: No module named 'Cryptodome')

Yet...

# python -m Cryptodome.SelfTest
and off it goes!
Ran 22656 tests in 48.420s


Implication that Cryptodome is in the 2.7 library?

More testing.

import Crypto.Cipher.AES

    mods=sys.modules
    if "Crypto" in mods:
        print("Found Crypto")
        print(mods["Crypto"])
        print(dir(Crypto))
        print(dir(Crypto.Cipher))
        print("\nCrypto.Cipher.AES: ",dir(Crypto.Cipher.AES))

shows

<module 'Crypto' from '/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/Crypto/__init__.py'>
['Cipher', 'Util', '__all__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__',
'__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__path__',
'__revision__', '__spec__', '__version__', 'version_info']
['AES', '_AES', '__all__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__',
'__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__path__',
'__revision__', '__spec__', 'blockalgo']

Crypto.Cipher.AES:  ['AESCipher', 'MODE_CBC', 'MODE_CFB', 'MODE_CTR',
'MODE_ECB', 'MODE_OFB', 'MODE_OPENPGP', 'MODE_PGP', '_AES',
'__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__',
'__name__', '__package__', '__revision__', '__spec__', 'block_size',
'blockalgo', 'key_size', 'new']


So how to tell whether I have crypto (??) or pycryptodome[x] ?

Signed, confused.com <grin/>

You had pip 9.0.1 installed previously -  from your earlier email:
> # pip -V
> pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)

This suggests at some point you ran the "pip install --upgrade pip" bit
you see appearing when you install things with pip at this point. Clearly
that's problematic so don't do that (problematic because the version dnf
installs is older and doesn't break things by virtue of how it gets
installed via that mechanism).

Whether pycrypto is truly uninstalled can obviously be hard to tell....
but there are lots of ways to work it out (even if it means re-installing
it via setup.py and then using the info from that install to remove it
thoroughly). See this link for more info on the general problem of
uninstalling such things:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1550226/python-setup-py-uninstall

And yet, the module's dictionary you listed tells us that there's version
info to be had so that will probably suffice:

  import Crypto
  print(Crypto.version_info)

I see (3,4,3)... how about you? Try this for both python 2.7 and 3.5.

The fact that the tests all worked is the second indication of health.
Between the two, you can tell whether the install is sane and correct.

Finally, I suggested you pip install both pycryptodome and pycryptodomex
to prove that a) both are working properly using the tests as described,
and b) that they can co-exist. As long as you don't have pycrypto
installed, pycryptodome will do. Otherwise, you use pycryptodomex instead.
Uninstall whichever you don't need - pycryptodome and pycryptodomex don't
share the same namespace.

I honestly don't think dnf is installing pip? It's a Python environment issue?
Post your scripts, which versions are you suggesting I use?
8.1 or the more recent 9.0.1 please?

Yes, I have 'upgraded' pip (again this morning). Do you think this is a problem?

Odd (wrong?)

which implies neither is installed by pip?

I'm wondering about Python and its search path?


I can only assume (somehow) Crypto is installed as part of Python install
or it is my installation using the source.

Yet using Linux 'locate', the only ones (other than source)
are:
/usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/beaker/crypto/pycrypto.py  ??
a group at
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycryptodomex-3.4.3-py2.7.egg-info
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycryptodomex-3.4.3-py2.7.egg-info/PKG-INFO
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycryptodomex-3.4.3-py2.7.egg-info/SOURCES.txt
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycryptodomex-3.4.3-py2.7.egg-info/dependency_links.txt
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycryptodomex-3.4.3-py2.7.egg-info/installed-files.txt
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycryptodomex-3.4.3-py2.7.egg-info/top_level.txt


I'm thinking that a total environment
https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#virtualenv
might be a way to do this.

Most confusing is where Python 3.5 is finding pycrypto!

Summary: restore the system pips as shown below, uninstall all the crypto
packages you've installed, verify they are totally uninstalled now, THEN
install what you need for each python (probably just pycryptodome) per
previous emails, and test to see it's working and the right version for
both pythons.

# This restores the system versions of pip (8.1.2 currently):
sudo dnf reinstall python-pip python3-pip

> problem?

Yes - and as I said previously: don't do that. It's not a pip problem per
se, but upgrading pip that way breaks all the aliases in a way that makes
it hard to use pip for python2 and python3 properly, complicating things
massively. (I don't know how to upgrade pip and preserve or re-create the
correct aliases right offhand, and an upgrade of pip to 9.x is not
required to make any of this work. Just restore the system pip as above
and use it.)

You still have the old pycrypto package installed for python 2.7, and you
have no crypto installed for 3.5.

> # pip uninstall pycrypto
> Cannot uninstall requirement pycrypto, not installed
> [root at localhost ~]# pip3.5 uninstall pycrypto
> Cannot uninstall requirement pycrypto, not installed

But you upgraded pip, so it's not clear it "pip" refers to python 2 (which
we already know doesn't have it) or python 3 (which does though it's not
clear if Pip will do the job. Use pip2.7 and pip3.5 for clarity - make
sure you have the system pips as stated earlier.

That said, what you see in 3.5 is probably a result of installing with
setup.py directly. We'll get to that below.

> I'm wondering about Python and its search path?

You're using locate, but you're not searching for the right things. Try
`locate pycrypto Crypto`.

I installed everything - pycrypto, pycryptodome and pycryptodomex AS A
TEST. Here's what locate found (tree roots for brevity, you probably don't
have all of these at this point):

/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/Crypto
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/Cryptodome
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycrypto-2.6.1.dist-info
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycryptodome-3.4.3-py2.7.egg-info
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycryptodomex-3.4.3.dist-info

/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/Crypto  (lots under here)
/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/Cryptodome  (lots under here)
/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/pycrypto-2.6.1.dist-info
/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/pycryptodome-3.4.3-py3.5.egg-info
/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/pycryptodomex-3.4.3.dist-info

Lots of stuff! as pycryptodome and pycrypto both install under Crypto,
lots of conflicts too. Let's fix it!

sudo pip2.7 uninstall pycrypto
sudo pip2.7 uninstall pycryptodome
sudo pip2.7 uninstall pycryptodomex

sudo pip3.5 uninstall pycrypto
sudo pip3.5 uninstall pycryptodome
sudo pip3.5 uninstall pycryptodomex

(Answer yes to the prompts that will appear for each package installed)

Now, update `locate`'s database and re-run locate (don't ask me why but
locate will give some state info about directories no longer present after
this if you don't).
sudo updatedb; locate pycrypto Crypto

You should see... nothing, except possibly some local files. You shouldn't
find anything under /usr/lib64/.

But you might, because I've got a feeling at least one of these was
installed without pip. If that's the case, remove the following manually
and carefully:

/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/Crypto
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pycrypto-*
/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/Crypto
/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/pycrypto-*

Didn't you say at some point you installed pycrypto using 'setup.py'?
What's above is the only way to undo that. Fortunately, it works.

At this point you should have NOTHING left of pycrypto, or
pycryptodome/pycryptodomex. Now you can reinstall and test what you need
as per previous emails. Most likely, you'll just install pycryptodome for
python 2.7 and 3.5.

Better to first understand how to maintain the system installs.


> Most confusing is where Python 3.5 is finding pycrypto!

Not confusing at all now, I hope.

Python rather than Operating system, yes I might agree.
Though why the tool used makes a problem I'm less sure?

So to get the desired output, which versions of pip are required?

One difficulty I'm seeing is that I am quite unable to determine which version
of Crypto I have? Surely it's not asking too much to identify at least those
versions for which you have some control? Either by name, version,
docstring or some such?

Reinstalling:

# locate Crypto shows
/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/Crypto

and

/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/Crypto
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/Cryptodome


which would seem to be a mix.
In the /usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages I have Crypto within which
__init__.py I see
# Written in 2008 by Dwayne C. Litzenberger <dlitz at dlitz.net>

So it is possibly pycrypto original.
Renamed this dir and my code fails, so this is where it's coming from.

pip3.5 install pycryptodomex
(my code still fails)

pip3.5 install pycryptodome
and my code runs.

Unless I get further problems, I'm quite prepared to leave it at that.
Seems I'm running pycryptodome (how to tell!) which is working.

Are you recommending staying with pip2.7 (8.1.2) and
pip3.5 (8.1.2) ?

Again, thanks for the help Marty.

When you reinstalled python-pip and python3-pip and got 8.1.2 for both,
that's the "system versions"... stick with that. If you directly upgrade
pip (via the command pip suggests), it causes problems.

As for how to check for exactly what pycrypto you have installed and
where, and how to remove them, refer to my previous email. I went into
great detail on exactly how to do that properly. Doesn't look like you've
done those steps yet.

The fact that pycrypto and pycryptodome conflict with each other means you
ought to uninstall both (per those instructions) and then only install one
of them (for best results, pycryptodome), per python version.

Not helpful?
print(Crypto.version_info)
(3, 4, 3)

print(Crypto.version_info)
(3, 4, 3)
>>> Crypto.__package__
'Crypto'
>>> Crypto.__path__
['/usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/Crypto']

is more helpful, though since this is pycryptodome, that name
would be more useful don't you think?
